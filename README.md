Inspired by the amazing Feltron report (here: http://feltron.com/FAR14.html), I am currently exploring my personal data. Although I didnâ€™t actively collect my own data last year, I was able to extract a surprisingly large amount of processable data, such as location data from Google. 


I did some data preprocessing in Python (see files) and rendered the data with Mapbox GL. Link to interface: https://melanie.imfeld.info/places.html
